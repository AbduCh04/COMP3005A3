The application is fairly simple to run 
Most of the work is done on the postgres pgAdmin4 side

Create a server on pgAdmin4 and make a database with the name A3, and make sure to keep the password admin, and name: postgres (hardcoded into the Java code)

Use the init.sql file and open it on pgAdmin4 to create the tables and the initial population of the tables

afterwards, simply running the java Main function would start a simple CLI interface with options to modify the database.
